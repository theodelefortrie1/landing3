		<h2><strong>The sneakers's world</strong></h2>
		<p>The term "sneakers" is part of everyday life today. It is used as much by streetwear lovers as by brands and distributors such as Chausport to designate a category of shoes inspired by models designed for sport and intended for everyday use. Appreciated above all for their style and great comfort, these sneakers are, in short, trainers adapted to the constraints of everyday life, whatever the environment and the context in which they are worn. When choosing them, buyers often do not pay attention to their technical characteristics, their main concern being to look after their look.</p>

			<h2> <strong>How did sneakers become a fashion phenomenon ? </strong> </h2>
			<p>Contrary to what one might think, sneakers did not appear in the 1980s with the emergence of hip-hop. If this current has undoubtedly favored the birth of the phenomenon, they actually date from the end of the <strong>19th century.</strong> </p>

			<h2> <strong>A rise parallel to that of basketball</strong> </h2>
			<p>The rivalry between adidas and PUMA will continue across the Atlantic on the floors of the NBA. The three-band brand will break through with its Superstar, worn by nearly 75% of the franchise's players at the end of its first years of marketing. With its famous "shell-toe" at the front and its raised heel offering perfect protection for the Achilles tendon, it will seduce stars such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who will swap his pair of Pro-Keds for that of adidas. . The club brand, joined by PUMA and its Clyde in 1973, will end the supremacy of Keds and Converse over the NBA. They will once again be joined by Nike, which will gain the upper hand over all of its competitors with the launch of its legendary <strong>Air Force 1</strong> in 1982.</p>

			<h2> <strong>Sneakers as a symbol of protest</strong> </h2>
			<p>At the end of the war, during which the army requisitioned the know-how and resources of the two brothers to have their soldiers' boots manufactured, the sneakers would become <strong>a symbol of protest against the segregation </strong>which was rife both in the United States and in the rest of the world. At the Mexico Olympics in 1968, the American riders Tommie C. Smith and John Carlos finished respectively 1st and 3rd in the 200 meters. When they step onto the podium, they will raise their gloved left fist and remove their pair of PUMA Suede, symbol of their membership in the Black Panther movement. </p>

			<h2><strong>The influence of hip-hop culture</strong></h2>
			<p> This is where hip-hop culture will have the greatest influence, initially with breakdance fans who sometimes come together in groups called "B-Boys". To engage in this dance halfway between art and sport, they need a pair of shoes capable of guaranteeing them excellent stability and offering them a style that conforms to a specific dress code.</p>
